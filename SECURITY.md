# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest `master` branch and the most recent release are supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

- Create a private security advisory on GitHub (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainers via a private channel if available

Include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any proof-of-concept code

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an assessment and remediation plan as soon as possible.
